# Geometric algorithms

In this repo, I put my excercises solutions for geometric algorithms class at AGH UST. Each lab folder cointains code wrote in Python, realized with jupyter notebook and report in .pdf.

In laboratories I carried out the following topics:
1. [Preliminaries](https://github.com/pvtrov/Geometric-Algorithms/tree/main/lab1) -> determinant in Geometry, Points classification against line
2. [Convex Hull](https://github.com/pvtrov/Geometric-Algorithms/tree/main/lab2) -> realized with Graham and Jarvis algorithms
3. [Triangulation of monotone polygon](https://github.com/pvtrov/Geometric-Algorithms/tree/main/lab3)
4. [Lines Intersection](https://github.com/pvtrov/Geometric-Algorithms/tree/main/lab4) -> realized with Sweeping algorithm
5. [Project](https://github.com/pvtrov/Geometric-Algorithms/tree/main/project) -> smallest enclosing circle solved with Welzl algorithm and minimum bounding rectangle problem solved with rotating calipers algorithm
